A Home Assistant custom integration for **Tado X** devices (the new generation of Tado smart thermostats and radiator valves).

> **Note:** This integration is specifically designed for Tado X devices. For older Tado devices (V3+ and earlier), use the [official Tado integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tado/).

## Features

| Entity Type | Features |
|-------------|----------|
| **Climate** | Temperature control, HVAC modes (Heat/Off/Auto), Preset modes (Schedule/Boost/Home/Away/Auto) |
| **Sensors** | Temperature, Humidity, Heating power, Battery status, **API usage monitoring**, **Weather** (outdoor temp, solar intensity), **Air comfort** (freshness, comfort level), **Heating time today** |
| **Binary Sensors** | Window open, Heating active, Manual control, Connectivity, Low battery |
| **Switches** | **Child lock** (per device), **Open window** control (per room) |
| **Buttons** | **Boost All**, **Turn Off All**, **Resume Schedules** (quick actions) |
| **Device Tracker** | **Mobile devices** for geofencing (home/away status) |
| **Services** | Temperature offset, Meter reading, **Energy tariff** (Energy IQ) |

### Climate Presets

- **Schedule**: Follow the smart schedule
- **Boost**: Quick temperature boost
- **Home**: Manually set presence to Home (override geofencing)
- **Away**: Manually set presence to Away (override geofencing)
- **Auto (Geofencing)**: Enable automatic presence detection

### Climate Temperature Control (Advanced)

When calling Home Assistant's `climate.set_temperature` on a Tado X climate entity, you can now pass these optional fields:

- **termination_type**: How long the manual override should stay active.
  - `TIMER` (default): Override expires after `duration`
  - `MANUAL`: Override stays active until manually changed
  - `NEXT_TIME_BLOCK`: Override lasts until the next schedule block
- **duration**: Override duration in minutes when `termination_type: TIMER` is used (default: `30`)

Example:

```yaml
service: climate.set_temperature
target:
  entity_id: climate.living_room
data:
  temperature: 21.5
  termination_type: TIMER
  duration: 30
```

### Quick Actions (Buttons)

Home-level controls for managing all zones at once:
- **Boost All**: Activate boost mode on all heating zones simultaneously
- **Turn Off All**: Disable heating in all zones (useful when leaving)
- **Resume Schedules**: Cancel all manual overrides and return to smart schedules

### Services

- **set_temperature_offset**: Calibrate device temperature readings (-9.9°C to +9.9°C)
- **add_meter_reading**: Upload meter readings to Tado Energy IQ
- **set_eiq_tariff**: Set energy tariffs for cost calculations in Energy IQ
  - Supports both m³ (gas) and kWh (electricity) units
  - Define tariff periods with start/end dates
  - Enables accurate cost tracking in Tado's Energy IQ dashboard
- **set_climate_timer**: Set room temperature with optional termination_type (TIMER, MANUAL, NEXT_TIME_BLOCK)

### API Usage Monitoring

Five sensors help you track API quota usage (values read directly from Tado API headers when available):
- **API calls today**: Number of API requests since midnight
- **API quota remaining**: Remaining requests
- **API quota limit**: Your daily quota (auto-detected from API: 100 free, 20,000 with Auto-Assist)
- **API usage**: Percentage of daily quota used
- **API reset time**: When the quota resets

These sensors use **real values from Tado API response headers** when available, providing accurate quota tracking.

## Supported Devices

| Model | Device |
|-------|--------|
| VA04 | Radiator Valve X |
| SU04 | Temperature Sensor X |
| TR04 | Thermostat X |
| IB02 | Bridge X |

## API Rate Limits & Smart Polling

Tado enforces daily API limits. This integration **automatically adapts** its polling interval based on your subscription:

| Subscription | Daily Limit | Auto Polling Interval | Actual Usage |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Without Auto-Assist | 5000 requests/day | Every 45 minutes | ~96 req/day ✅ |
| With Auto-Assist | 20,000 requests/day | Every 30 seconds | ~2,880 req/day ✅ |

### Configuration Options

Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Tado X** → **⚙️ Configure** to:

- **Enable Auto-Assist**: Toggle if you have an Auto-Assist subscription
- **Custom polling interval**: Override the automatic interval (30s - 3600s)
- **Enable weather sensors**: Outdoor temperature, solar intensity, weather state (+1 API call)
- **Enable mobile device tracking**: Device tracker for geofencing (+1 API call)
- **Enable air comfort sensors**: Air freshness and comfort level per room (+1 API call)
- **Enable heating time sensors**: Daily heating runtime per room (+1 API call)

**Note:** Optional features are disabled by default for free tier users to optimize API usage. Auto-Assist users have all features enabled by default.

### API Counter Persistence

The API call counter is **persisted across restarts** - your quota tracking continues accurately even after Home Assistant reboots.

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication issues:** Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Tado X → **⋮** → Reconfigure

**Rate limiting:** If entities become unavailable, you may have exceeded the daily limit. Wait until the next day or get Auto-Assist subscription.

## Manual Installation

1. Download `custom_components/tado_x` from this repository
2. Copy to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Why This Integration Exists

Tado X devices use a different API than previous Tado generations. While Tado recommends using Matter integration, many users experience significant issues with Matter setup:

- **Greyed-out pairing buttons** preventing Matter device linking
- **Failed pairing attempts** with cryptic error messages
- **Tado's official solution** requires a [full device reset](https://help.tado.com/en/articles/10264695-how-can-i-fix-matter-device-linking-errors) - impractical for remote installations (vacation homes, rental properties, elderly parents' homes)

### Why Not an Official Home Assistant Integration?

The Home Assistant team has chosen not to add Tado X support to the official Tado integration. Based on community discussions, this decision was made at Tado's request - they don't want third-party integrations using their cloud API because "it costs them money".

But here's the thing: **users pay for this API access**. We buy Tado devices knowing an API exists. Many of us pay an additional Auto-Assist subscription specifically for extended API access. So why restrict how we use what we're already paying for?

The only official alternative is Matter, which is extremely limited compared to Tado's own app:
- No boost mode or presets
- No temperature offset calibration
- No Energy IQ or meter readings
- No detailed heating statistics
- No child lock controls

And unlike most smart home manufacturers, Tado provides **no local API** - neither on their classic devices nor on the new Tado X line. This leaves cloud API as the only way to get full functionality.

**This is why ha-tado-x exists.** This integration uses Tado's official cloud API to provide what paying customers deserve: full Home Assistant integration for Tado X users who:
- Cannot get Matter working (greyed-out buttons, failed pairing)
- Have remote installations where device resets aren't feasible
- Need features that Matter simply doesn't support
- Want to actually use the API they're paying for
