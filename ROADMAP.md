# Roadmap

This document tracks planned features and enhancements for the Tado X Home Assistant integration.

## Planned Features

### P1 - Critical Priority

- **🔥 Local Control Mode** - Control Tado devices locally via HomeKit protocol
  - Zero cloud dependency for temperature control and on/off commands
  - No API rate limits - unlimited updates
  - Instant response times (~50ms vs ~500ms cloud)
  - Works even when Tado cloud is down
  - Real-time state updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  - Local SQLite storage for state history

  **How it works:** Tado bridges expose a HomeKit interface on your local network. By pairing with this interface, we can send commands directly to devices without going through Tado's servers.

  **Requirements:**
  - One-time HomeKit bridge pairing setup
  - Bridge and Home Assistant on same local network

  **Status:** Research phase - evaluating [TadoLocal](https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal) implementation

### P2 - High Priority

- **📊 Energy IQ Dashboard** - Gas consumption and cost tracking
  - Daily/weekly/monthly consumption sensors
  - Cost estimates based on configured tariffs
  - Comparison with previous periods

- **📅 Schedule Management** - Full schedule control from Home Assistant
  - Read current heating schedules
  - Modify schedules via service calls
  - Copy/duplicate schedules between days
  - Switch between schedule profiles

- **📈 Heating Statistics** - Advanced heating analytics
  - Historical heating time per room
  - Heating efficiency metrics
  - Monthly reports with trends

### P3 - Medium Priority

- **🌡️ Historic Data** - Historical temperature, humidity, and heating data
  - Temperature graphs in HA
  - Long-term statistics integration

- **💧 Hot Water Control** - Dedicated water heater support
  - Water heater entity
  - Timer for hot water schedules
  - Boost hot water service

- **🤖 Smart Schedule Suggestions** - AI-powered optimization
  - Analyze usage patterns
  - Suggest schedule improvements
  - Integration with HA history

### P4 - Low Priority

- **📍 Away Radius Configuration** - Configure geofencing radius
- **❄️ AC Support** - Air conditioning control (if requested)
  - Fan speed control
  - Swing adjustment
  - DRY/FAN/AUTO modes
- **📺 Display Messages** - Send messages to thermostat displays
- **⏰ Early Start Settings** - Control pre-heating behavior
