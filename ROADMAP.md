# Roadmap

This document tracks planned features and enhancements for the Tado X Home Assistant integration.

## Planned Features

### P1 - Critical Priority

- **🔥 Local Control Mode** - Control Tado X devices locally via Thread/Matter
  - Zero cloud dependency - works even when Tado servers are down
  - No API rate limits - unlimited updates
  - Ultra-fast response times (~10-50ms vs ~500ms cloud)
  - Real-time state updates
  - Full local temperature control

  **How it works:** Tado X devices use the Thread protocol with Matter support. The Bridge X acts as a Thread Border Router, enabling direct IPv6 communication with all devices on your local network. Tado officially supports local control via Matter: *"The devices continue to work even without a connection to the Tado cloud."*

  **What's possible:**
  - Temperature control ✓
  - On/Off switching ✓
  - Home/Away modes ✓
  - Heating schedules (Matter 1.4+) ✓
  - Real-time state monitoring ✓

  **Technical approaches:**
  1. **Matter integration** - Native Matter protocol (most promising)
  2. **HomeKit bridge** - Via [TadoLocal](https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal) project
  3. **Thread direct** - Direct IPv6 communication with Thread devices

  **Requirements:**
  - Bridge X and Home Assistant on same local network
  - One-time Matter/HomeKit pairing setup

  **Status:** Research phase - investigating Matter and Thread integration options

### P2 - High Priority

- **📊 Energy IQ Dashboard** - Gas consumption and cost tracking
  - Daily/weekly/monthly consumption sensors
  - Cost estimates based on configured tariffs
  - Comparison with previous periods

- **📅 Schedule Management** - Full schedule control from Home Assistant
  - Read current heating schedules
  - Modify schedules via service calls
  - Copy/duplicate schedules between days
  - Switch between schedule profiles

- **📈 Heating Statistics** - Advanced heating analytics
  - Historical heating time per room
  - Heating efficiency metrics
  - Monthly reports with trends

### P3 - Medium Priority

- **🏷️ Improved Flow Sensor Naming** - More descriptive entity names for flow temperature sensors
  - Rename `_none` entities to include "flow" prefix (e.g., `flow_max_temperature`, `flow_auto_adapt`)
  - Better discoverability for OpenTherm flow temperature controls
  - Requested by: @TexTown (#26)

- **🌡️ Historic Data** - Historical temperature, humidity, and heating data
  - Temperature graphs in HA
  - Long-term statistics integration

- **💧 Hot Water Control** - Dedicated water heater support
  - Water heater entity
  - Timer for hot water schedules
  - Boost hot water service

- **🤖 Smart Schedule Suggestions** - AI-powered optimization
  - Analyze usage patterns
  - Suggest schedule improvements
  - Integration with HA history

### P4 - Low Priority

- **📍 Away Radius Configuration** - Configure geofencing radius
- **❄️ AC Support** - Air conditioning control (if requested)
  - Fan speed control
  - Swing adjustment
  - DRY/FAN/AUTO modes
- **📺 Display Messages** - Send messages to thermostat displays
- **⏰ Early Start Settings** - Control pre-heating behavior
